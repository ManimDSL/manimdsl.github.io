# valgolang.github.io

This is the repository for the official documentation for VAlgoLang, made using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), which uses [reStructuredText](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html) (.rst) as its markdown format.

If you would like to work on this repository locally, please do the following:

1. Install Sphinx using the [recommended commands](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html) for your operating system. 
2. Once you are in the root directory for `valgolang.github.io`, run

```
make html
```

This will generate the HTML pages in the same format as they are when deployed. These will then be available in the `build/html` subdirectory.
